At UTMB, a provider's ratings are only posted when she/he has a minimum of 30 completed surveys within the past twelve months.

(Isn't it crazy how motherhood changes everything?)I realized after being a patient myself that traditional medical practices aren't serving patients, particularly busy women, in the ways they want and need.Endless forms, crowded waiting rooms, frustrating phone trees, stone-age tech, surprise bills and 15-minutes appointments are simply unacceptable in today’s world. - you deserve better. I decided to take a stand against a broken system and build an innovative new practice rooted in respect for your time, transparency on all costs, a personalized and proactive approach to care and direct access to me 24/7.Juniper is membership-based practice designed for patients who are willing to invest in their long-term health and partner with me to address root causes through evidence-based lifestyle changes, rather than medication alone. Even if you're healthy, the time is now to establish a relationship with a doctor who cares and helps you lay the foundation for lifelong wellness. If this resonates with you, I hope you’ll make the leap and join Juniper. I sincerely look forward to being your doctor!

Made me feel super comfortable on our first meeting with his humble and caring demeanor. I highly recommend him. Miguel Millie is awesome! Amazing bedside manner and super knowledgeable. My teenage son saw her last year for an injury and my teenage daughter just saw her for some routine medical care. Office staff is courteous and I love the paperless “paperwork”. No wait time and they actually took us earlier than appointment time. L.E. Best doctor I’ve had since childhood! Incredibly helpful in getting me just the healthcare I need!

Dr. Emmanuel Lee is an amazing and caring doctor who warrants a five-star review. One of the few doctors out there who still cares about their patients. I cannot recommend him enough. Dania Everything is usually smooth when I come to my appointments and Manny Lee is wonderful! Su I have seen Dr. Lee many times. He is an excellent clinician, always willing to take the time to answer all your questions. I have never felt rushed in an"

Nurse Practitioners (NP) are clinicians who blend clinical expertise in diagnosing and management of health conditions with a special focus on disease prevention and health promotion across the lifespan.NPs must complete a master's or doctoral degree program, are board-certified, and adhere to a code for ethical practices.Our NPs work closely with highly-trained specialists when a health condition warrants.Our passion is educating patients and their families regarding healthy lifestyles and health care options. We believe in preventing disease is much better than treating illness.​We want to give you the resources to live well, to understand your risk factors (whether genetic or self-imposed), and work together to develop a healthy lifestyle.
